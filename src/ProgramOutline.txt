# This is the start of the PyBuild Project

# Program:
# 1. Get shell/os (bash or powershell) [Done]
# - sys.platform.startswith('linux' or 'win32')

# 2. Get compiler (gcc g++, msvc c++) [Done]
# - Ask user directly: Type either gcc, msvc, or kotlin
# - Or use argv to get command-line arguments

# 3. Get src directory [Done]
# - Tell user directly: To build, enter the path to folder/directory where
#   your source files are
# - Or use argv to get command-line arguments

# 4. Generate command to compile and link all source files and libraries in src [Done]

# 5. Look for static or dynamic library creation option [X]
# 6. If YES, then compile src and turn src into a static or dynamic library
#    If NO, then don't

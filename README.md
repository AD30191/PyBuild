# PyBuild
Toy-Project for building C++ projects on Linux and Windows

This project was meant for learning python. I already had implemented the core of the fucntionality is a neat language called "Arturo."
So, it was mainly a task of translating.

If you want to use this script, then you will need to be on Windows or Linux. The project src directory will also have to be almost barebones
and no special compiler or linker options needed.

At this point in time, not all, the functionality I wanted even for the Toy version is implemented. If you need a production-quality build-tool, then
there any many, many tools elsewhere for free.

However, if you only need to compile and link source files with no special compilier or linker options, then this script isn't half bad for Windows.

TODO:
- Testing on Linux
- Implement library build options
- Recursive file listing
- Increase usefulness by looking at most common build configs
